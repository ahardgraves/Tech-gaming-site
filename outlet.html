  				  	  In the U.S, 81% of youths play at least once a month, 8.5% of them become addicted and “the average 8 to 12 year old now plays at least 13 hours of video games per week. While the average 13 to 18 year old plays 14 hours of video games per week” (Metrics 2.0, 2007). With such a variety of game types out there, it is difficult to say if video games in general are good or bad. Luckily, there have been countless studies done on this and information on the pros and cons can be easily found.

   				  	<dt><strong>Cons of Video Gaming</strong><dt>
   				  	 <dd><!--Data point 1 Starting-->
   				  	  A study from Buchman and Funk found that “violent games became consistently popular across grades for both boys and girls” (Cesarone, 1998). Educational games were more popular for some of the girls being asked, but throughout all the age groups, violent video games never lost their superior power in the gaming industry.
   				  	 </dd><br><!--Data point 1 Ending-->

					  <dd><!--Data point 2 Starting-->
					   Studies have shown the negative effects violent video games have on the younger generation. Calvert and Tan did a study on young adults, where they compared the differences between playing versus observing violent video games. Studies found that “students who had played a violent virtual reality game had a higher heart rate, reported more dizziness and nausea, and exhibited more aggressive thoughts in a posttest than those who had played a nonviolent game” (Cesarone, 1998). Although these studies do not exactly determine if aggression increases in their experimenters, they are able to observe behavioral changes that include more aggressive patterns.
					  </dd><br><!--Data point 2 Ending-->

					  <dd><!--Data point 3 Starting-->
					   Another negative aspect of video games is the fact that kids are spending too much time playing the games rather than physically playing outside. Funk and Buchman did another study on the effects video games have on kids, but in this one, they were testing for self-competence. Results found that “for boys, but not for girls, a stronger preference for each of the three types of violent games was associated with lower self-competence scores in one or more developmentally important areas, including academic, interpersonal, and behavioral skills” (Cesarone, 1998).

					  <dd><!--Data point 4 Starting-->
					  Finaly, let’s take a look at the obvious reason why video games are not beneficial to a child’s development, obesity. According to the CDC, in 2009-2010, 12.1 percent of children ages 2 to 5 are obese, 18 percent of 6 to 11 year olds are obese, and 18.4 percent of 12 to 19 year olds are obese. By spending much of their free time on the computer or on their game console, kids are not going out and participating in activities that will keep them physically fit and healthy.

					 <dt><strong>Pros of Video Gaming</strong></dt>
					  <dd><!--Data point 5 Starting-->
					  Research has shown that playing video games can be beneficial to a number of cognitive functions and may also contain some social benefits. The first thing a person discovers in a game is that following directions is of the utmost importance. In order to progress in games, one must first learn to follow the guidelines, restrictions and components of them. As the player findes new challenges, he must use problem solving to locate solutions. This is true for educational games, mind games, and RPGs alike(Gee, 2003). The player can also learn strategy and management of resources, mapping, pattern recognition, how to judge the situation and practice reading.  They can also perform quantitative calculations (through educational games, managing finances, buying and selling for profit, etc. (Tumbokon, 2014).
					  </dd><br><!--Data point 5 Ending-->

					  <dd><!--Data point 6 starting-->
					  Video games also increase hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and spatial reasoning (Tumbokon, 2014). For example, in shooter games, the player keeps track of their position, direction, speed, aim, results and more. The brain processes all this information and then coordinates with the hands since all actions are done through the controller or keyboard. These skills can be applied to real world situations like surgical procedure (Florida Hospital, 2013). 
					  </dd><br><!--Data point 6 Ending-->

					  <dd><!--Data point 7 starting-->
					  In conclusion, gaming is stimulating, a learning experience and a social activity. The reason why people find it so enjoyable is that games are usually the right degree of challenge and the player takes an active role (unlike watching television) so there is an incentive to achieve (Gee, 2003). Let’s also not forget that many games, like “Rise of Nations” or “Age of Mythology” are educational and have a lot to offer in areas like science, politics, history and cultural studies and some games are practical, like pilot-training simulations. The gaming world is very popular. Thus, playing video games has become a social activity. In fact, nearly 60% of frequent gamers play with friends, 33% with siblings and 25% with a spouse or parents. Many games require cooperative play and logistics, comradeship and frequent interactions between team members.
