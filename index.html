   					  Futurists of the 1950s and '60s predicted that by the 2000s<br> Flying cars and airborne robots would be a part of our everyday lives.<br>Instead, we live in a world dominated by live streaming, smartphones and social networks.

 			 	       <dt><strong>10 Technologies That Are Changing the World</strong></dt><br>

  				     <dt>1. Voice assistants</dt>
  				      <dd>
  				  	   In four years, the majority of American homes are anticipated to own a voice assistant device like an Amazon<br>
  				  	   Echo or an Apple Homepod.Thanks to the power of artificial intelligence (AI), voice assistants will grow increasingly helpful.<br>Voice assistants are making an important impact in markets across the world<br>some observers expect that in the future we will communicate with technology through voice rather than through text.

   				     <dt>2. CRISPR</dt>
   				      <dd>
   				  	   Thanks to CRISPR, genetic disease may be eliminated.<br>
				  	     CRISPR Cas-9 (an abbreviation standing for "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats")<br>is a gene-splicing technology capable of locating and eliminating mutated parts of your DNA.<br>Once this material is destroyed, crispr technology can replace the sections with non-mutated variants.
				       </dd><br>

   			      <dt>3. Robot assistants</dt>
   					   <dd>
   					    Companies such as Boston Dynamics have already created a wide range of robot assistants that can be used<br> in factories or in war. The company started as an arm of MIT and has since pioneered the<br>creation of intelligent robots that operate effectively todays world.
   					   </dd><br>

   				    <dt>4. Augmented and mixed reality</dt>
   					   <dd>
   					    Apple's newest phones are equipped with augmented reality capabilities, and a recent report says that the<br>
   					    company is developing an AR headset that will replace the iPhone in two to three years.
   					   </dd><br>

   				    <dt>5. Regenerative medicine</dt>
   				     <dd>
   				   	  Doctors are already producing ready to order body parts. To get started,<br> doctors scrape cells off the body part in question and develop them in a petri dish. Over time, the body part grows healthy<br>enough that it can be implanted inside the individual.  A company named Organovo, has developed a printer capable of 3D<br> printing body parts. In time, this new technology will become increasingly mainstream, providing patients with lifesaving organ replacements.
				       </dd><br>

   				    <dt>6. Driverless vehicles</dt>
   					   <dd>
   					    Automakers like Tesla, General Motors and Volvo have already created semi-autonomous vehicles. But self<br>driving technology is fastly developing. General Motors says that it will display a car that has no steering<br>wheel or pedals by the year of 2019.  Meanwhile, Uber is leading the charge for pilotless flying vehicles, and has teamed up with<br>NASA to create an air-traffic-control system. Uber is also working with aircraft manufacturers to develop<br> prototypes, with the intention of launching a beta program in 2020.
					     </dd><br>

   				    <dt>7. Reusable rockets</dt>
   					   <dd>
   					    One of the costliest aspects of space exploration is the building of sophisticated and powerful rockets capable of<br>transporting thousands of pounds of equipment into space. Because we have figured out how to land rockets<br> even the large ones used to launch the Falcon Heavy -- will help to reduce the cost of space travel.
   					   </dd><br>

   				    <dt>8. Cryptocurrency</dt>
   					   <dd>
   					    At one point this year, Bitcoin was worth more than $19,000 per coin, and while the value of the cryptocurrency<br>has since declined, a single coin is still worth thousands of dollars.  Cryptocurrency may be controversial today,<br> but it has steadily become increasingly mainstream. Some of the largest hedge funds are betting on Bitcoin which<br> is just the beginning of a cryptocurrency revolution.
   					   </dd><br>

   				    <dt>9. Quantum computing</dt>
   					   <dd>
   					    Quantum computers depend on quantum bits to carry information. These bits can exist in a state which allow quantum<br> computers to process challenging datasets much better than traditional computers do. Because of this, quantum computing<br> can help to produce machine learning that might otherwise be impossible figure out. While the<br> technology is still in its early stages, companies like Microsoft and Google are placing billions in developing<br> supercomputers capable of developing highly accurate predictive models. These models can be used in everything from<br>self-driving cars to marketing campaigns.	
   					   </dd><br>

   				    <dt>10. Artificial intelligence and automation</dt>
   					   <dd>
   					    Some of the world's biggest companies are turning to automation in order to better serve customers and to<br>reduce costs. Big-box retailers use automated warehouses to sort and ship products, while social media networks use<br>automation to moderate comments, and credit card companies use automation to locate fraud.
