  				  	   This is one of the most average concerns connected with the growth of technology: Do digital devices actually cause eye strain? According to The Vision Council, the short answer is yes. They state, "Many individuals suffer from physical eye discomfort after screen use for longer than two hours at a time." Have you ever looked at your phone in the middle of the night, only to be partially blinded by the brightness? Our eyes did not develop to read tiny text on tiny screens with bright lights. It’s not only our eyes that may be affected, however. Some worry that digital eye strain may also affect your head, neck, and shoulders, depending on your posture as you use different devices.

   				  	 <dt>1. Brain Development:</dt><!--Sub title of data point 1-->
   				  	 <dd><!--Data point 1 starting-->
					   Social media can play a huge role in a child’s environment and ultimately affect their developing brain by impacting how it processes information, reacts to situations, and recalls events. Resent research suggest that a child’s brain development is molded by social media use and exposure in the following ways: 
					   Adolescents suffering from internet addiction may, over time, experience structural changes in their brain and have lower grey matter. Teens who suffer from other addictive tendencies (i.e substance dependency) may, therefore, be predisposed to becoming addicted to social media and the internet The multitasking commonly associated with social media can cause adolescent children to take longer to accomplish tasks, which can also hinder the quality of their homework or studies

					  <dt>2. Privacy & Reputation:</dt>
					  <dd><!--Data pont 2 starting-->
					   When social media users have their accounts set to private, privacy on social media is virtually non-existent. Anything posted on a social site can be easily re-posted and subsequently seen by third parties. Social media lacks proper privacy, which leads to issues for young users ranging from image-based abuse to not being accepted for a job or college program.

					  <dt>3. Body Image & Self-Esteem</dt>
					   <dd><!--Data point 3 starting-->
					     Teenagers today are exposed to images and statuses that display perfection. Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram have a tendency to display idealized body-types through images that have been digitally altered, and therefore set unrealistic and unattainable beauty standards for adolescent children whose bodies are undergoing uncontrollable changes. Pictures of models with flawless complexions can make them feel insecure about having hormonal skin, and overtly sexualized representations of young-adult females in mainstream media can be hugely conflicting for teenage girls who, until recently, were only just children. Research says that exposure to unrealistic beauty standards through social media can affect how teenagers perceive themselves. These perceptions can negatively affect a teenager’s physical and mental health.

					  <dt>4. Social Skills<dt>
					   <dd><!--Data point 4 starting-->
					     Solid social skills help teenagers establish and maintain relationships. Because teenagers and children spend a lot of time interacting over social media sites and apps, many of them are establishing social interaction skills that don’t necessarily apply to the offline world. While, of course, social media can help to nurture and strengthen existing relationships, it’s integral that teenagers also learn how to have meaningful, face to face exchanges with people.
					     Social isolation is also a major risk factor for both depression and suicide. Now adolescents spend more time online and less time interacting with people in the real world, they risk not only struggling to create effective social skills but also exposing themselves to mental health issues.
					   </dd><br><!--Data point 4 ending-->

					  <dt>5. Mental Health Problems</dt> 
					   <dd><!--Data point 5 starting-->
					     Research suggest that teenagers who spend more than a couple of hours a day on social media sites are more likely to experience mental health problems such as psychological distress. Teenage girls are particularly susceptible to peer pressure and are therefore at risk of having negative online experiences that can affect their development and lead to anxiety disorders and depression.
