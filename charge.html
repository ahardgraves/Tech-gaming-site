  				  	<strong><dt>Where the future is headed</dt></strong><!--Bold title text-->
  				  	 <dd>
  				  	  In 1820, a person could typicaly expect to live for about 35 years, 94% of the global population lived in great poverty, and less than 20% of the population was literate. Today, human life expectancy is over 70 years, less than 10% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, and over 80% of people are literate. These improvements are due mainly to advances in technology, beginning in the industrial age and continuing today in the information age. There are many exciting new technologies that will continue to develope the world and improve human life.

   				  <li>
   				  	<strong><dt>Clean Energy</dt></strong>
   				  	 <dd>
   				  	   Because of steady technological and manufacturing advances, the cost of solar cells has fell 99.5% since 1977. Solar will soon be more cost efficient than fossil fuels. The price of wind energy has also dropped to an all-time low, and in the last decade represented about a third of newly installed US energy capacity. 
					   Inovative organizations are taking advantage of this. In India there is an initiative to convert airports to self sustaining clean energy. Tesla is making high performance, affordable electric cars, and installing electric charging stations worldwide.

					<strong><dt>Augmented & Virtual Reality</dt></strong>
					 <dd>
					    Companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft are investing billions of dollars to make VR and AR more immersive, comfortable, and affordable. People sometimes think VR and AR will be used only for gaming, but over time they will be used for all kinds of activities. We'll use them to create 3-D objects, to meet with friends and colleagues from around the world. Even for medical applications, like treating phobias or helping rehabilitate paralysis victims. VR and AR have been displayed in science fiction films for decades. In the next few years, they'll finally become reality. 
					 </dd><br>

					<strong><dt>Drones</dt></strong>
					 <dd>
					   Drones are being used to inspect critical infrastructure like bridges and power lines, to survey areas struck by natural disasters, and many other creative uses. Amazon and Google are building drones to deliver household items. The startup Zipline uses drones to deliver medical supplies to remote villages that can't be accessed by roads. 
					 </dd><br>

					<strong><dt>Artificial Intelligence</dt></strong>
					  <dd>
					     AI can be applied to just about any field. For example, in photography an AI technique called artistic style transfer transforms photographs into the style of a given painter. Google built an AI system that controls its datacenter power systems, saving hundreds of millions of dollars in energy costs. The broad promise of AI is to liberate people from repetitive mental tasks the same way the industrial revolution liberated people from repetitive physical tasks. 
					  </dd><br>

					<strong><dt>Online Education</dt></strong>
					  <dd>
					    Now a days anyone with a smartphone can study almost any topic online, accessing educational content that is mostly free and increasingly high-quality. You used to have to go to school or buy programming books to learn computer programming. Now you can learn from a community of over 40 million programmers at Stack Overflow. YouTube has millions of hours of free tutorials and lectures as well, many of which are produced by top professors and universities. The quality of online education is getting better every day. For the last 15 years, MIT has been recording lectures and compiling materials that cover over 2000 courses.
